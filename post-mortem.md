## GSAN Repronim Workshop (Post-Mortem)
**Date:** February 22-23, 2020
**Instructors:** Elizabeth Levitis, Gregory Kiar
**Website:** https://github.com/gkiar/repronim-gsan 
**Registrants (Attendees):** 30 (7)

**Event Overview:**
- The objective of the workshop was to introduce graduate students to both Datalad and Boutiques, two key tools enabling the FAIR consumption/production of data and tools.
- Students were taught from public resources, namely the Datalad Handbook and Boutiques NeuroLibre tutorial, in an effort to both increase the quality of these resources through feedback and demonstrate the process of education through open resources.
- Students were expected to complete Software Carpentry's Unix and Python tutorials prior to attending, to ensure a baseline level of programming knowledge.

**Outcomes:**
- While the number of attendees was far fewer than the total number of registrants, by the end of the workshop those in attendance were asking insightful questions about the tools being taught, and were effectively moving through the presented workflows.
- Using both the Datalad Handbook and Boutiques Neurolibre tutorial as guides through the content, we collected a number of pieces of feedback to improve both resources. We have and will continue to provide this feedback to the resource developers.
- Using Compute Canada (or another shared computing resource) proved to be an effective way to minimize installation burden or the issue of instructors debugging many configurations throughout the workshops. In the event that students did not have accounts, a set of temporary authentication keys was generated and distributed by one of the instructors for an isolated machine.

**Feedback:**
- The in-depth nature of the designed workshop ended up being relevant to a limited audience. The technologies being introduced rely on a computer science background that some students lacked, limiting their ability to do more than follow along, while many of those who did have adequate background were able to use the resources without much support from the instructors.

**Suggestions for Future:**
- From our experience, it would make more sense to introduce these topics and tools in a short (1-2 hour) overview presentation, in which the motivations and benefits of the tools are introduced and links to the resources provided. Then, subscription to the Repronim mailing list, relevant GitHub repositories, and Neurostars would be encouraged as ways to get hands-on support using the guides when problems arise.
