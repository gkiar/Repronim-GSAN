title: "ReproNim's HBHL Computational Reproducibility Workshop"
teaching: 2 days.
exercises: Specific exercises will be available via specific lessons.
questions:
- "Why is reproducibility important?"
- "Who is this module for?"
- "How can I get some help if I get stuck solving an exercise or answering a question?"
- "When and where are the future ReproNim training workshops?"
objectives:
- "This module should provide you with the ability to implement version control, run reproducible analyses, and apply statistical analyses to your data."

A key foundation needed to support reproducible research is the proper handling of research outputs.  There are a number of best practices and tools available to researchers to ensure that their data is sufficiently FAIR (Finable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable).

### What is a ReproNim module?

A Repron

### Who is this module for

The module is for upper-level undergraduate and graduate students who are working with either neuroimaging data or other large biomedical datasets and are interested in learning about why and how to practice reproducible research.

### What will you learn

You will learn how to work properly with data such that changes to data and code are tracked, run analyses in a parallelized fashion using Compute Canada's resources, and apply proper statistical analyses.

### What are the current lessons for this module?

1. [Lesson 1.]({{site.root}}/01-reproducible-summary) Reproducibility summary
2. [Lesson 2.]({{site.root}}/02-introduction-bash) Introduction to bash
3. [Lesson 3.]({{site.root}}/03-version-control) Overview of version control using Git
4. [Lesson 4.]({{site.root}}/04-break) Coffee break
5. [Lesson 5.]({{site.root}}/05-virtualization) Virtualization
6. [Lesson 6.]({{site.root}}/06-datalad-create) Create a Datalad dataset

### Do I need to code ?  What language ?

You can learn a lot without coding, however, some of the lessons and exercises will require some coding. So, yes, you should code. We have (mostly) adopted python for the language, it may not be your first choice but we think some knowledge of python coding will help you anyways. We will try to help as much as possible by providing tutorials, examples, and links to installation instructions.

### ReproNim is truly *open*

The ReproNim training events can only accommodate a limited number of participants.
Nevertheless, we are committed to openness and we are committed to providing our
materials in an open format, with liberal licenses, and through a publicly accessible website. You can also contribute to this training module - just [fork us on Gihub](https://github.com/ReproNim/module-FAIR-data)!
