title: "ReproNim's HBHL Computational Reproducibility Workshop"
teaching: 2 days.
exercises: Specific exercises will be available via specific lessons.
questions:
- "Why is reproducibility important?"
- "Who is this module for?"
- "How can I get some help if I get stuck solving an exercise or answering a question?"
- "When and where are the future ReproNim training workshops?"
objectives:
- "This module should provide you with the ability to implement version control, run reproducible analyses, and apply statistical analyses to your data."

A key foundation needed to support reproducible research is the proper handling of research outputs.  There are a number of best practices and tools available to researchers to ensure that their data is sufficiently FAIR (Finable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable).

### What is a ReproNim module?

### Who is this module for?

The module is for upper-level undergraduate and graduate students who are working with either neuroimaging data and 

### What will you learn

You will learn how to properly work with data to ensure that they are FAIR. This module will also provide information on technologies and platforms that can be utilized within your research.

### How much time this should take me?

That really depends on your familiarity with concepts covered in the episodes and your capacity to write some code. If you have no familiarity at all, this may take you a longer time, for instance 2 full weeks. If you have good familiarity, some of the information will be already partially known and it may take you a few days to go in detail through this material.

### What are the current lessons for this module?

1. [Lesson 1.]({{site.root}}/01-Web-of-Data) Overview of strategies for making research outputs available, with an emphasis on data
2. [Lesson 2.]({{site.root}}/03-Ethics) Introduction to ethics surrounding privacy, data sharing, and algorithmic decision-making
3. [Lesson 3.]({{site.root}}/04-Data-Publishing) Overview of best practices in data publishing
4. [Lesson 4.]({{site.root}}/05-Your-Laboratory-Datastore) Provides information on a number of research data management platforms
5. [Lesson 5.]({{site.root}}/06-Semantic-Data-Representations) How to setup a testing framework to revalidate analyses as data and
software change

### Do I need to code ?  What language ?

You can learn a lot without coding, however, some of the lessons and exercises will require some coding. So, yes, you should code. We have (mostly) adopted python for the language, it may not be your first choice but we think some knowledge of python coding will help you anyways. We will try to help as much as possible by providing tutorials, examples, and links to installation instructions.

### ReproNim is truly *open*

The ReproNim training events can only accommodate a limited number of participants.
Nevertheless, we are committed to openness and we are committed to providing our
materials in an open format, with liberal licenses, and through a publicly accessible website. You can also contribute to this training module - just [fork us on Gihub](https://github.com/ReproNim/module-FAIR-data)!
